## Testing with Mocha-Chai
In this project, I am learning to test functions using the Chai library.
## What is Mocha?
  - [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) is a JavaScript test framework that runs on Node.js and in the browser.
  - Mocha does not include an assertion library so that's why we use Chai.

## What is Chai?
  - [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) is an assertion library that pairs well with any JS testing framework
  - Chai has 3 different styles of assertion: `assert`, `expect`, and `should`
  - In this project I am using an`expect` style.
