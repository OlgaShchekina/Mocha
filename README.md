## Testing with Mocha-Chai
In this project, I am learning to test functions using the Chai library.
## What is Mocha?
  - [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) is a JavaScript test framework that runs on Node.js and in the browser.
  - Mocha does not include an assertion library so that's why we use Chai.

## What is Chai?
  - [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) is an assertion library that pairs well with any JS testing framework
  - Chai has 3 different styles of assertion: `assert`, `expect`, and `should`
  - In this project I am using an`expect` style.

## Installation

## [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

The `chai` package is available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) To install it, type in Terminal:

    npm install chai
     
## Plugins
* `chai-arrays` - for testing arrays:

 ```
npm install chai-arrays
 ```
 
* `chai-string` - for testing strings:
 ```
npm install chai-string
 ```
* `chai-sorted` - for sorting
```
npm install chai-sorted
```
Go to Settings/Preferences -> Libraries and download libraries with the plugins names.  
The file "index.js" contains functions for testing and their descriptions.  
The The folder "test" contains a list of tests for each function separately.
